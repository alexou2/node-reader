this is  a list of the features that I am planning on adding


    features:
        download cover images from mangadex
        creating a database for users to continue their progress
        adding a "start reading" button
        add metadata for each manga
        encode the file names in order to avoid replacing characters like ?, !, \
        add search by name functionnality to manganato
        add more sites like asura scans
        improve UX
        add javascript to resize image sizes
        redo the sorting function for the chapters
        restart the server when a new manga has finished downloading
        hide the cover image link from the chapter list
        cleanup code
        change the add-manga.ejs form depending on the website (enable/ disable language selection)
        add a progress bar in the top-bar to see when a manga has finished downloading
        give advanced options for downloading mangas (change name, download only a certain ammount of chapters, download only new chapters)



    bug fixes:
        fix bug where the path can't be accessed because it finishes with a problematic character
        fix axios errors when downloading pages
        catch error when no match is found when downloading chapters
        add a timeout to fix error 429 when downloading from mangadex (max 40 requests/ min)
        make server more resiliant to crashing
